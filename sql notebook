*****query and sorted
SELECT column
FROM table
DISTINCT means delect repetitive things 
SELECT a AS b #rename 
how to save the query above: add a VIEW at beginning
CREATE VIEW aaa as
SELECT * = SELECT all
{SELECT
FROM
WHERE color='yellow'
ORDER BY length#(ASC)alphabetically
LIMIT 3;
}
SELECT a,b
ORDER BY certification, release_year DESC;#first sorted by certification second by released year
*****grouping data
GROUP BY comes before ORDER BY
ALWAYS go with COUNTING() 查某个大类里头某个小类有多少

-- Find the release_year and film_count of each year
SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS film_count# you cannot ???????
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year;
